    <p>I'm new to programming and, since C++ was the first language I had contact with, I'm really interested in undertanding how it works and all what I can create by telling a computer how to do it. </p>
    <p> A programming language is a system of notation for writing computer programs.[1] Most programming languages are text-based formal languages, but they may also be graphical. They are a kind of computer language.

The description of a programming language is usually split into the two components of syntax (form) and semantics (meaning), which are usually defined by a formal language. Some languages are defined by a specification document (for example, the C programming language is specified by an ISO Standard) while other languages (such as Perl) have a dominant implementation that is treated as a reference. Some languages have both, with the basic language defined by a standard and extensions taken from the dominant implementation being common.

Programming language theory is the subfield of computer science that studies the design, implementation, analysis, characterization, and classification of programming languages. </p>

<p> There are many considerations when defining what constitutes a programming language.

Computer languages vs programming languages
The term computer language is sometimes used interchangeably with programming language.[2] However, the usage of both terms varies among authors, including the exact scope of each. One usage describes programming languages as a subset of computer languages.[3] Similarly, languages used in computing that have a different goal than expressing computer programs are generically designated computer languages. For instance, markup languages are sometimes referred to as computer languages to emphasize that they are not meant to be used for programming.[4] One way of classifying computer languages is by the computations they are capable of expressing, as described by the theory of computation. The majority of practical programming languages are Turing complete,[5] and all Turing complete languages can implement the same set of algorithms. ANSI/ISO SQL-92 and Charity are examples of languages that are not Turing complete, yet are often called programming languages.[6][7] However, some authors restrict the term "programming language" to Turing complete languages.[1][8]

Another usage regards programming languages as theoretical constructs for programming abstract machines and computer languages as the subset thereof that runs on physical computers, which have finite hardware resources.[9] John C. Reynolds emphasizes that formal specification languages are just as much programming languages as are the languages intended for execution. He also argues that textual and even graphical input formats that affect the behavior of a computer are programming languages, despite the fact they are commonly not Turing-complete, and remarks that ignorance of programming language concepts is the reason for many flaws in input formats. </p>
    
    
    
    <p>To get familiarized with this, I'm going to leave a short definition about C++: <p>
    
    <strong> <p style="color:green;font-size:18px;"> <mark> C++ introduction </mark> </p> </strong>
    <p>C++ is a cross-platform language that can be used to create high-performance applications.<p>
    <p>C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, as an extension to the C language. <p>
    <p>C++ gives programmers a high level of control over system resources and memory. <p>
    <p>The language was updated 4 major times in 2011, 2014, 2017, and 2020 to C++11, C++14, C++17, C++20.<p>

    <p>C++ is one of the world's most popular programming languages.<p>
    <p>C++ can be found in today's operating systems, Graphical User Interfaces, and embedded systems.<p>
    <p>C++ is an object-oriented programming language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs.<p>
    <p>C++ is portable and can be used to develop applications that can be adapted to multiple platforms.<p>
    <p>C++ is fun and easy to learn!<p>
    <p>As C++ is close to C, C# and Java, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to C++ or vice versa.<p>

<p> Hope you enjoy learning about programming, and that my personal space helps you a little bit understanding the very basics of C++.  </p>
